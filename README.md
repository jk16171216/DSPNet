# DSPNet: A Transformer Network Based on Multi-Scale Feature Modeling and Patch Representation for Long-Term Multivariate Time Series Forecasting

## Description 
This repository provides the official implementation of **DSPNet**, a deep learning framework for long-term multivariate time series forecasting. The project includes source code, datasets, and experimental scripts for reproducing the results reported in our research. DSPNet introduces a multi-scale modeling approach and uses patch representations, combined with a Transformer-based architecture, to effectively capture more comprehensive multi-scale temporal dependencies. This repository allows researchers and practitioners to: - Reproduce experimental results on benchmark datasets. - Apply DSPNet to their own multivariate time series forecasting tasks. - Extend or adjust the architecture for applications related to AI and data-driven modeling.
